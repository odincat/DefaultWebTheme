# Default Web Theme (pls help me finding a better name for this)

## The project
This project was made to provide a simple, nice looking theme for people who are not that experienced and want a website to create content on.

## Features
* Mobile responsive 

This feature is finished, but the logo in the navbar will be hidden when opening the menu on a phone.

* "smart" darkmode

The site checks the setting of the device and determine wether it should use darkmode or not.
You can edit colors in the **style.css** file.

* COMING SOON: Aligning items using an id/class

Title says it.

## Disadvantages
* Ugly code

Srs i didnt spend much time on making the code beautiful, maybe i will do that in the future.

* Learning

This can help or cannot. But you would probably learn more if you created a site by yourself ;)

## IMPORTANT
You need at least a little bit of html/css knowledge in order to use this. If you dont know how to add images or links then this is useless.
If you try to open the file locally it will probably look scuffed because of the iframes. If you want to display properly, use the vs code extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
