# Default Web Theme

## The project
This project was made to provide a simple, nice looking theme for people who are not that experienced and want a website to create content on.

## Warning
This isn't quite finished, DON'T **git clone** this yet. I want this to be updateable with ease, so that you dont have to change multiple things in a file to be compatible with the newest version. 
If you see something under the releases, then that version should be fine.

When the V1 releases I will also enable the **Template repository** option for the maximum amount of convenience

## Features
* Mobile responsive 

This feature is finished, but the logo in the navbar will be hidden when opening the menu on a phone.

* "smart" dark mode

The site checks the setting of the device and determine whether it should use dark mode or not.
You can edit colors in the **style.css** or **nav.css** file.

* COMING Soon: Align items using an id/class

Title says it.

## Disadvantages
* Ugly code

Srs i didn't spend much time on making the code beautiful, maybe i will do that in the future.

* Learning

This can help or cannot. But you would probably learn more if you created a website by yourself ;)

## IMPORTANT
You need at least a bit of HTML/CSS knowledge in order to use this. If you dont know how to add images or links then this is useless.
If you try to open the file locally it will probably look scuffed because of the iframes. If you want to display properly, use the vs code extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.Timeserver).
